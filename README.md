This was a quick project to practice rust. The code quality is not great and not much work was put into creating a fancy TUI. If you would like to use it for some
reason just clone it and run cargo run. Then pick where you want to move by typing a number between 1 and 7. I may add an AI in the future if I get bored one day.
